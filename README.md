🧠 Early Stroke Detection Using Machine Learning

🚀 A Machine Learning-Based Web App for Predicting Early Stroke Risk



📌 Overview
This project aims to predict the early risk of stroke using Machine Learning algorithms. The model takes key health parameters such as age, glucose level, BMI, smoking status, and stroke history to estimate the likelihood of a stroke.

The web application is built using Streamlit, allowing users to input their details and get an instant prediction.
